Welcome to Nusantara Chain. This website contains information about Nuchain and how to use the
Nuchain network.

## What is Nuchain?

Nuchain is a distributed system ([blockchain](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/block_chain)) _as a
service_. Designed as a robust and secure distributed application development platform, Nuchain is
developed _open source_ and the code is publicly accessible on
[Github](https://github.com/nusantarachain).

Currently, nuchain is being developed by the Rantai Nusantara Teknologi (RNT), a non-profit
organization that aims to advance the digital ecosystem in Indonesia, especially in the area of
decentralized applications.

The Rantai Nusantara Teknologi (RNT) has been registered with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights
of Indonesia under the registration number **AHU-0017288.AH.01.04** in 2021.

## Motivation

Nuchain was created with the aim of welcoming the 3rd generation Web (Web 3.0) through a distributed
and secure system called blockchain ([blockchain](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/block_chain)).

## Why Blockchain?

- Almost all internet applications that exist today run centrally (centralized). One of the passions
  of Web 3.0 is the widespread use of distributed applications. Blockchain, which is a distributed
  system by nature, can be used as the foundation for the era of distributed internet applications.
- Security. The blockchain system is secured using cryptography at its most basic layer, providing
  high security guarantees.
- Blockchain is a very reliable _trustless system_ to build applications that require legitimacy
  guarantees without the need to trust each other.

Nuchain is not designed to be a _crypto currency_, but as a distributed application platform (DApps)
which will later become a new ecosystem in the era of digital technology that requires openness,
clarity, legitimacy, and good governance.
