## Regulation

Here are some basic rules for contributors:

1. Do not `--force` push or modify Git _history_.
2. Pull requests are suggested to be related to _issue_ (if any).
3. For contributions in the documentation, we use the _Prettier_ plugin to customize the _style_ of
   writing in each document. You can run it using the command `npx prettier --write ./docs`.
